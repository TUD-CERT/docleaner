<h2>Using the docleaner API</h2>
<p>Next to the web interface, this webservice can also be consumed via its RESTful API at <code>{{ base_url }}/api/v1/</code>. You can utilize it to upload and clean individual documents from their metadata, much like utilizing the user-facing frontend at <a href="{{ base_url }}">{{ base_url }}</a>. In case you want to process a bunch of documents without having to keep track of all the resulting individual job IDs, the API offers a <code>sessions</code> endpoint that can be associated with uploaded documents to keep track of multiple jobs running in parallel.</p>
<p>The examples on this page demonstrate API usage with <a href="https://curl.se">curl</a>, which is available for all major operating systems. For technical details such as available endpoints please have a look at the <a href="/docs" target="_blank">API documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Processing a single document</h3>
<p>Upload the document with</p>
<p><code>curl -F doc_src=@/some/local/path.pdf "{{ base_url }}/api/v1/jobs"</code></p>
<p>This returns some JSON, which contains a unique job ID (<code>jid</code>) for each uploaded document:</p>
<p><code>{"id":"(jid)","type":0,"log":[],"metadata_result":{},"metadata_src":{},"status":1}</code></p>
<p>Depending on the current workload, processing your document may take some time. To check the job status, execute</p>
<p><code>curl {{base_url}}/api/v1/jobs/(jid)</code></p>
<p>The returned document might be quite large, because it contains your document's metadata after the job has been processed. To figure out the job's status, have a look at the value of <code>status</code>. It should be interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>0: Job has been created, but not yet put into the work queue</li>
    <li>1: Job is enqueued and waiting to be picked up by a worker</li>
    <li>2: Job is currently being executed</li>
    <li>3: Job has been executed successfully</li>
    <li>4: Job execution has encountered an error, please report such bugs together with the problematic document to <a href="mailto:cert@tu-dresden.de">cert@tu-dresden.de</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After a job has been successfully processed (<code>status</code> is <code>3</code>), download it via</p>
<p><code>curl -o /download/path.pdf {{ base_url }}/api/v1/jobs/(jid)/result</code></p>
<p>After they have been processed, jobs are kept on the server for <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Afterwards, the job and all associated documents are purged from the database automatically. Alternatively, a job can be removed immediately with <code>curl -X DELETE "{{ base_url }}/api/v1/jobs/(jid)"</code>.</p>
<h3>Batch-processing multiple documents</h3>
<p>Start by creating a new session with <code>curl -X POST {{ base_url }}/api/v1/sessions</code>, which returns an empty session such as</p>
<p><code>{"id":"(sid)","jobs_total":0,"jobs_finished":0,"jobs":[]}</code></p>
<p>Save the returned session ID <code>(sid)</code> somewhere. To associate jobs with that session, upload documents by specifying that session ID in the upload request, e.g.</p>
<p><code>curl -F doc_src=@/some/local/path.pdf "{{ base_url }}/api/v1/jobs?session=(sid)"</code></p>
<p>This returns something similar to</p>
<p><code>{"id":"(jid)","type":0,"log":[],"metadata_result":{},"metadata_src":{},"status":1}</code></p>
<p>However when using a session, you don't have to remember individual job IDs (jid). Instead, you can track the status of all jobs associated with a session by either visiting <code>{{ base_url }}/sessions/(sid)</code> in a browser, which shows a periodically self-refreshing status overview and all associated jobs, or receive the same data as JSON via the API: <code>curl {{ base_url }}/api/v1/sessions/(sid)</code>. An example response for a session with two associated jobs is:</p>
<p><code>
    {"id":"(sid)",
    "created":"2023-01-24T15:24:58.636000",
    "updated":"2023-01-24T15:26:14.238000",
    "jobs_total":3,
    "jobs_finished":1,
    "jobs":
    [{"id":"(jid1)",
    "created":"2023-01-24T15:26:12.659000",
    "updated":"2023-01-24T15:26:12.688000",
    "type":0,
    "status":2},
    {"id":"(jid2)",
    "created":"2023-01-24T15:26:12.165000",
    "updated":"2023-01-24T15:26:12.223000",
    "type":0,
    "status":2}]}</code></p>
<p>After each job was processed successfully (<code>status</code> is <code>3</code>), download its resulting metadata-cleaned document with</p>
<p><code>curl -o /download/path.pdf {{ base_url }}/api/v1/jobs/(jid)/result</code></p>
<p>In contrast to single document uploads, jobs associated with a session are stored for <strong>24 hours</strong> on the server. Afterwards, the session and all associated jobs are purged from the database. Alternatively, a session and all of its jobs can be removed immediately with <code>curl -X DELETE "{{ base_url }}/api/v1/sessions/(sid)"</code>. Be aware that deleting a session that way requires that all associated jobs have finished pressing (job status SUCCESS/3 or ERROR/4).</p>
